/**
 * The purpose of this class is to provide minor additional functionality
 * for the AndrinoIME testing classes that want to use ActivityUnitTestCase
 *
 * @author Thomas Radloff  bostontrader@gmail.com
 *
 * Buttons of the Activities under test will create intents that would ultimately
 * be used to launch other activities.  We cannot directly follow this flow
 * but we can verify that intents are created, as well as their content.
 *
 * We cannot use Espresso testing with this class.  Doing so tends to hang the test.
 * Use ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 instead.
 *
 * Each test method has a call to startActivity.
 * We cannot factor out startActivity from the test methods
 * into setUp because the docs (1) tell us not to, and because doing so
 * simply doesn't work.  We also need to annotate our test methods
 * with @UiThreadTest or startActivity will fail.
 *
 * Apparently this has something to do with which thread setUp and test
 * methods use (2).
